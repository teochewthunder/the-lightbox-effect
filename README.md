# The Lightbox Effect

This is a HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation of the famous Lightbox.

## HTML
Basically a nested div.

## CSS
The outer div fills up the entire screen, is positioned *absolute* and has a translucent grey background. The inner div is a placeholder for the content.

## JavaScript
This contains a few parts.
- an array containing the HTML used to populate content.
- a function to open the outer div with the appropriate content in the inner div.
- a function to close the outer div.

## Special Effects (optional)
Mostly CSS3 transitions to open and close the Lightbox slowly.
